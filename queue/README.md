# Queue

A queue is a data structure, in which, the elements are stored in the order of FIFO (First In First Out). The main operations, that are performed on a queue, are:

1. Enqueue - To push an element into the queue.

2. Dequeue - To delete an element from the queue.

5. Show queue - Shows the content of the queue.

Some basic uses of queue:

1. Mostly used in operating systems to share resources amongst multiple consumers. 

2. Some of the examples are disk scheduling, CPU scheduling, process scheduling, etc.

# Circular Queue

Elements are stored and operations are performed in FIFO (First In First Out) but the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle.
